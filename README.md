# MeetAi! Interview Case for Senior App Developers
You have been invited for an interview with the CTO of MeetAi! and our Lead App Developer. A requirement before the interview is to finish this task over the weekend. Please take your time and do not rush things, this case project is very important in evaluating your proficiency in app development. Please read the **Q&A for both [Figma](https://github.com/thailemeetai/mobile-assignment#figma-qa) and [Coding](https://github.com/thailemeetai/mobile-assignment#coding-qa)** so that you are not lost on what requirements you need.

## Case Background
Congratulations! 

A Stanford student with a lot of money from university poker nights has hired you on a freelance contract to help him conceptualize his dating app idea. They have paid a designer already to make some assets and his friend from CS107 has made a JSON to set up the data. This student is really lazy however and really does not know what he wants to do for the app other than making it look nice. They now want to pay you some money to take on that responsibility and make it “look good”. Since you are the expert, he is willing to let you make changes if you see any problems or have any creative ideas yourself. He has given you this task for the weekend and expects it in his mailbox at latest on the **21st of June, Sunday 23:59.**

## Task details
You are provided a link to a Figma and this github repository. Please implement the UI and as much as you can from the JSON. If there’s missing data or too much data, YOU should decide on what should be added and what should not. For the missing UI assets, you may use the internet to find anything that can replace the design. You may also skip it entirely if you feel that it is unnecessary.

## Figma Q&A
- What is the **Slider-bar** for?

The Slider-bar should be shown up after they like the person so that they can give a specific rating to how much they like their potential match. 

- What is the **Heart-pulse** for?

Heart-pulse is an animation that the designer thinks would enhance the UX for the app. So when a user presses the empty heart on the top right corner of iPhone8 - 1, the heart should get filled and pulse according to Heart-pulse.

- How should the **images** be displayed?

You have the freedom to implement it any way you want. 
Here is an example of implementation: The images on the top should be switched when you swipe the screen in that area while the images on the bottom should be fullscreen if you tap on one of them.

- How do I download the Figma **assets**?

You can export all the assets as SVG-files individually or in chunks. Please use Google if you have zero experience with Figma, we expect you to be able to find information yourself.


## Coding Q&A
- What **language** should I use?

We are working in **Flutter** so we would *prefer* if you wrote it in **Dart** to align with our tech stack. However, we will accept outstanding **Swift** and **Kotlin** code as well if that is what you prefer. **React Native** will be somewhat acceptable as well since it shows analogous skills with **Flutter**.

- Do I have any limitations on what **dependencies or packages** I can use?

No, not at all. Do your best work and if you feel that you need to take assets from other places it's perfectly normal.

- Do I have to write any **APIs** myself?

No, the JSON file provided should just be representative of fake API requests for your code.

## Evaluation
Here are some specific evaluation metrics we will use:
- **Coding practice** - We don’t want to see messy code. We want to see well-structured and well-commented code such that a new developer joining the project should be able to understand it without any problems.
- **Implementation skills** - We want to see how you manage to implement the requirements given by the case. Are some things too hard? Are some things implemented in a really innovative way? There are many ways to impress or disappoint us here.
- **Design choices** - Even though we will have designers and other creative people on the team, we really value developers that can identify what looks good and what looks bad. Because in the end, it’s us app developers who are the people finalizing the product.
- There are other things as well that we will check such as performance, future planning and how well you present your thinking during the interview.

MeetAi! wants strong problem-solvers with a creative mindset. We are a startup with a lot of ambition and the people who work with us are hard-working and innovative. Therefore, this task is very open-ended and can be solved in a multitude of ways. As an app developer, you need to know when a design choice is good, redundant or even outright bad. Here in MeetAi! we encourage everyone to come up with their own ideas and to give constant constructive feedback to each other, so feel free to get creative!

Good luck!
